- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @johnny27817
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in gaining the skills necessary to work in the field as a software developer.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning computer science with a concentration in software engineering.
- üíûÔ∏è I really enjoy playing video games and while I think it is a bit of a pipe dream, I would love to work on video games and see how they come together.
- üì´ My preferred method of contact is through email at johnny27817@yahoo.com


1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did the want you to design?

    The Gaming Room wanted to develop a web-based application to serve multiple platforms. The application in question, a game called Draw It or Lose It, had                     already been developed for the Android operating platform so the challenge was to make it run on multiple web-based platforms. The client also had a few requirements that     they wanted us to implement such as; they wanted each individual game to have one or more teams allowed and each of those teams to have multiple players assigned to it,       and game and team names to have unique identifiers so that users could check if certain names are already in use.
    
2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

    I learned a lot throughout the course of this class and I think I did my best work on the last part of the design document, that is the recomendation portion of the           software design template
    
    
3. What about the processes of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    
    Writing code is difficult and wrting in plain english is much easier. So, when coming up with the design document it was helpful to be able to think of the process that       the code will have to go through and the specific tasks that the code will have to accomplish and then translating that into functional code.
    
4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you choose? How would you improve it?

    Definitely the evaluation section that involved the table and discussing the different strngths and weaknesses of the three main operating systems. The Microsoft word         document was not cooperating when I was trying to format the table and therfore I did not put as much effort into adding the information due to frsturation as I should       have. Also, I have recently learned a plethora of more information about the individual operating systems and thus can add more specified information about each.

5. How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the when designing?

   Interpreting the user's needs and successfully implementing them into your software is a very pivotal part of any software project because without the user there will not    be any need for a project in the first place. Creating software design documents is very helpful for interpreting user needs into code because if you can translate their      low-level wanted and needs into high level english that is closer to code than translating that higher level english into code will be all that much easier. Diagrams are      also a good way of represesnting user needs and what the code needs to do. 

6. How did you approach designing software? what techniques or strategies would you use in the furture to analyze and design a similar application?  

   Up until this point, I have always written code first and then added comments to my code afterward. But from now on I think I am going to try and form a new habit of          writing a whole document full of comments first, with large blank spaces to be filled in with code. Writing the steps in plain english before writing the code is a            surefire way to having efficient and functional code
